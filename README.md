This project extends the [UIColor](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIColor_Class/)
class to include class methods for the [CCS named colors](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colornames.asp).
To use the extension simply add `UIColor+NamedColors.swift` to your project and call the name of the color you want
as a class method on `UIColor`.

```swift
view.backgroundColor = UIColor.mediumBlueColor()
```

# Swift Code Generation

The `UIColor+NamedColor.swift` file is generated by ruby.
The colors are loaded from the `color_names.json` file.
Aliases for colors are selected from the `color_aliases.json` file.

The generation is done by the code in `generate.rb`.

To generate your own colors, modify `color_names.json` and/or `colr_aliases.json` and run `ruby generate.rb`.
